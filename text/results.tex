        Interaction between a bulk fluid and a rigid body on macroscopic scales. \textbf{A}) Temporal snapshot of the mesh (black lines) and velocity field (arrows). The direction of the velocity field is indicated by the arrows, and its norm by their color. The rigid body (ellipse) is allowed to pivot about its left focal point (red dot), and the related angle with respect to the $x$ direction is denoted by the red arc.   \textbf{B}) Color map of the surface tension for the same temporal snapshot as \textbf{A}.

        Interaction between a bulk fluid and an elastic body on macroscopic scales. The notation is the same as in \cref{fig_fluid_rigid}, and the elastic body is depicted as a red mesh.
