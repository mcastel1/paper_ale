        Helfrich fluid layer described with the generalized \acl{al} gauge. The layer is subjected to a gravitational field directed along the $X^2$ axis, in the direction of negative $X^2$.  \plab{A} Displacement field $\vec{U}$, which relates the reference and the current configuration, shown in red and green, respectively. \plab{B} Stretching $\nu$.  \plab{C} Tangent angle $\psi$. \plab{D} Tangential velocity. Arrows show the velocity direction, and the  color code the velocity norm. \plab{E} Normal velocity, whose value is shown with the color code. \plab{F} Surface tension. All panels refer to the same instant of time, shown on top.
