\begin{enumerate}
    \item Dereny study the steady state with arc-length gauge
    \item In the dynamics, arc-length gauge does not work
    \item We show how to use a generalized arc-length gauge and how to correctly incorporate it into the dynamics to obtain a proper dynamics
    \item In this dynamics we implement the Crank-Nicolson method and prove it to be numerically stable
    \item We couple the membrane dynamics to a bulk fluid. The membrane is a complex elastic body -> We proceed by steps:
          \begin{enumerate}
              \item Bulk fluid + rigid body
              \item Elastic body with stable elastic model (stable under compression)
              \item Bulk fluid + elastic body with stable elastic model
              \item Bulk fluid + membrane
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item Bulk fluid and membrane both described with Crank-Nicolson method -> we prove that the resulting dynamics is numerically stable
                    \end{itemize}
          \end{enumerate}
