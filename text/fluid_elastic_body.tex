\section{Fluid and elastic body}\label{sec_fl_elastic}

In this Section, we will build on the analysis of \cref{sec_fl_rigid} and put \ac{bflu} into interaction with a more complex physical object---an \ac{ela}. Only the main results will be presented here; their derivation follows the lines of  \cref{sec_fl_rigid}.
